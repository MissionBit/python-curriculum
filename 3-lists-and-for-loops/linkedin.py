# Example of LISTS

# You want to set up a linkedin account to have a record of all of your experiences and education

# You set up your account and list these items as your experiences and education when it asks you
# for information
my_experiences = ["Waiter", "Coder"]
my_education = ["High School"]

# You go to college and want to update your Linkedin!

# Luckily you can go back and add to your list of experiences and education
my_experiences.append("Teaching assistant")
my_education.append("College")

# Now you will get Waiter, Coder AND Teaching Assistant
print(my_experiences)

# Now you will get High School AND College
print(my_education)
