#Let's review conditionals and lists!

#TASK: Create a list of chores corresponding to days of the week. Your list should be of length 7 for each day of the week and include one chore on each day. Ask the user an input question to get the current day of the week. 
#Using conditionals, return the chore in the list corresponding to the day from the user input. For example, if the user inputs "Tuesday", return the 3rd chore in the list since Tuesday is the 3rd day of the week.

#Example 1:

#LIST OF CHORES: Clean room, Homework, Study Python, Homework, Volunteer, Laundry, Plan next week
#USER INPUT: Tuesday
#PRINT: Study Python
