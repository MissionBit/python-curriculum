# Black-Owned Restaurant Finder: Lists exercises

####################################################################################################
# Think about different cuisines (as many as you want) and store them in a list. Using what you
# learned in the previous exercises, write a function that accepts a parameter called `cuisines` and
# asks the user what cuisine they are interested in. If the cuisine they entered is not in the list
# of `cuisines` that was passed into the function, print the string "Please choose one of these
# cuisines: [LIST OF CUISINES HERE]".

# Find the name of at least three black-owned restaurants nearby and store their names in a list.
# Then, write a function that accepts a list of restaurants and prints out the name of each
# restaurant, one line at a time.

# TIP: Use Google Maps to find nearby black-owned restaurants

# Now, write another function that also accepts a list of restaurants, but prints out the name of
# each restaurant in a numbered list.
# Example:
# 1. <RESTAURANT 1>
# 2. <RESTAURANT 2>
# 3. <RESTAURANT 3>

# Find out how far away each restaurant is (in miles) and store those distances in another list.
# Then, write a function that not only accepts a list of restaurants, but another list of their 
# distances, and prints out the name of each restaurant AND how far away it is in a numbered list.
# Example:
# 1. <RESTAURANT 1> is 2.4 miles away
# 2. <RESTAURANT 2> is 6.8 miles away
# 3. <RESTAURANT 3> is 10.2 miles away
