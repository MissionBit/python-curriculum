# Black-Owned Restaurant Finder: Dictionaries exercises

############################################ Exercise 1 ############################################
# Find the name of at least three black-owned restaurants nearby, and find out how far away they are
# from you in miles. Store the names of the restaurants and their distances in a dictionary, with
# the restaurant names as the keys and the distances as the values. Using the dictionary, print out
# the name of each restaurant and how far away it is, with each restaurant on its own line. Example:
# <RESTAURANT 1> is 6.8 miles away
# <RESTAURANT 2> is 2.4 miles away
# <RESTAURANT 3> is 10.2 miles away

# TIP: Use Google Maps to find nearby black-owned restaurants
