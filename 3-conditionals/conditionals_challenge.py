# Challenge 1 - Greater than 10
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Write python that initializes a variable called num to 4 and prints "True" if it is greater than
# 10 and "False" if it is less than 10.  Make sure that is prints out false since num is set to 4.
# Change num to some other values and see what happens!

# Write your code here

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Challenge 2 - Doubled greater than 10
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Write python that initializes a variable called num to 4 and prints "True" if 2 times num is
# greater than 10 and "False" if it is less than 10. Make sure that is prints out false since num is
# set to 4. Change num to some other values and see what happens!

# Write your code here

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Challenge 3 - Even or Odd
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Write python that initializes a variable called num to 4 and prints "Odd" if it is odd and "Even"
# if it is even. Make sure that is prints out even since num is set to 4. Change num to some other
# values and see what happens!

# Hint: use mod (%)

# Challenge 4 - Favorite Color

# You want to see if you and your best friend have the same favorite color. Initialize a variable
# called "my_fav_color" and have them initialize one called "friend_fav_color". If they are the

# Challenge 5 - Favorite Food Type

# Pick your favorite food from this list: Pizza, Salad, Steak, Strawberries, Ice cream, Cheese,
# Pasta,  Carrots, Apples. Initialize a variable named food to be that food. Then using conditionals
# using the list of food we have, print out what food group the food is from. Your code should still
# work when you change the food variable.

# Hint: use elif
