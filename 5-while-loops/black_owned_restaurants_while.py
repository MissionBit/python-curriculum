# Black-Owned Restaurant Finder: While loop and nesting exercises

############################################ Exercise 1 ############################################
# Using your code from the previous "conditionals" exercises, write code that asks the user if they
# would like takeout or delivery. If the user typed in something other than "takeout" or "delivery",
# print the string "Please choose either 'takeout' or 'delivery'." Keep on repeating the question to
# the user as long as they keep typing incorrect responses.
